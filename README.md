In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a vast dataset comprising 1,30,000 Amazon customer orders to identify and resolve underlying issues leading to order rejections. Leveraging Python and powerful data analysis tools, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the factors impacting order rejection rates.

The EDA process revealed crucial patterns and trends within the dataset, enabling me to address key pain points and enhance the overall order fulfillment process. Armed with these insights, I successfully developed a robust classification model that accurately predicts order rejections.

The project's primary goals were to optimize the order fulfillment system, reduce rejection rates, and enhance customer satisfaction. By employing sophisticated data analysis techniques and building a powerful classification model, this project has made significant strides towards achieving those objectives.

The GitHub repository contains the Python code used for data analysis, the classification model's implementation, and detailed documentation highlighting the project's methodology, findings, and actionable recommendations for improving Amazon's order processing system.

Through this project, I hope to contribute to the broader community's understanding of data analysis and classification techniques while providing practical solutions for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of e-commerce order processing. Feel free to explore the repository and leverage the code and insights to advance your own data analysis projects and machine learning endeavors.
